The code goes :

1) PrOBalearning.R: datacleaning and wrangling -> model fitting -> model selection  ->  Between group statistics -> plots
2) Recovery.R: Simulation of behavior from parameters -> Parameter estimation from simulated data -> correlation

3) Time_Learning_ses1.R: Check between groups difference in the numbers of trials needed to pass the learning phase
