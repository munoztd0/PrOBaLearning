The code goes :

1) Scripts_learningT0.R: datacleaning and wrangling -> model fitting -> model selection 
2) Stats.R: Between group statistics + plots
3) Recovery.R: Simulation of bheavior from parameters + Parameter estimation from simulated data (Twin method validation) + correlation

4) Time_Learning_ses1.R: Check between groups difference in the numbers of trials needed to pass the learning phase
5) Time_Learning_ses2.R: Check within session difference in the numbers of trials needed to pass the learning phase
